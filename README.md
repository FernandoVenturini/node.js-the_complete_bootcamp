🎯 About the Bootcamp
This bootcamp is a deep dive into backend development with Node.js, covering:
✅ Core Node.js (Event Loop, Modules, File System)
✅ Express.js (RESTful APIs, Middleware, Routing)
✅ MongoDB & Mongoose (NoSQL Database, CRUD Operations)
✅ Authentication & Security (JWT, Bcrypt, Helmet)
✅ Error Handling & Debugging
✅ Deployment (Heroku, AWS, Docker basics)

Each module includes hands-on projects to reinforce learning.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools
Category	Technologies
Backend	Node.js, Express.js, RESTful APIs

📂 Projects & Code Examples
1. Node.js Fundamentals
📌 File System & Streams – Built a CLI tool to process CSV/JSON files.
📌 Event Emitters & Async Patterns – Practical examples of callbacks, promises, async/await.

2. Express.js RESTful APIs
📌 Natours API – A tourism management API with CRUD operations, filtering, and pagination.
📌 Authentication System – JWT-based login/signup with password encryption.

3. MongoDB & Mongoose
📌 Blog API – Full-featured blog with user roles (admin/author) and comments.
📌 Aggregation Pipeline – Complex data queries for analytics.

4. Real-World Features
📌 Stripe Payments Integration – Bookings and payments system.
📌 Email Notifications – Nodemailer + SendGrid for transactional emails.

5. Deployment & DevOps
📌 Dockerized Node.js App – Containerized a REST API.
📌 AWS S3 File Uploads – Storing user-uploaded files in the cloud.

(Each project has its own folder with a detailed README.md explaining its purpose and setup.)
